# pysitemanagerapi

Python client for the official UniFi Site Manager API v0.1

The Site Manager API Client is written using Python3 core modules only and has no dependencies on third-party modules.

To install from GitHub:
```
%pip install git+https://github.com/KHT-Admin/pysitemanagerapi
```
### API Key

The example and test code assumes that the UniFi API key is stored in a environment variable.

On current macOS versions the key can be added to ~/.zshrc:

```
export UNIFI_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
```
